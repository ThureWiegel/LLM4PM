# Python Email API

Aspose.Email for Python via .NET is a suite of flexible and easy to use class libraries brought together to produce the most powerful Email Programming Component available today. The Python Email API implements a number of network protocols including SMTP, MIME, POP3, IMAP for creating, sending & receiving messages without needing to have any other component. It can also manipulate, extract & convert message files & message archives.

Aspose.Email for Python via .NET also provides classes and algorithms that are useful for time-oriented recurrence patterns, or schedules. The central concepts are coherent with the iCalendar RFC (2445), so it is easy to incorporate iCalendar features into your own python applications.

## Email Features

- Open or save emails in a variety of formats.
- Parse, read and save Microsoft Outlook messages and message archives.
- Comprehensive Object Model for MIME messages.
- Embed objects to email messages.
- Send individual or bulk emails.
- Create emails using Mail Merge while incorporating data from different types of sources.
- Create & consume iCalendar compliant recurrence patterns.
- [Connect to POP3 server for message management](https://docs.aspose.com/display/emailpythonnet/Connect+to+POP3+Server).
- [Access and manage emails, folders & filters using IMAP](https://docs.aspose.com/display/emailpythonnet/Connecting+to+IMAP+Server).
- [Send or forward messages via SMTP](https://docs.aspose.com/display/emailpythonnet/Sending+and+Forwarding+Messages).

personalStorage = PersonalStorage.from_file(dataDir + "template.pst")
folderInfoCollection = personalStorage.root_folder.get_sub_folders()
for folderInfo in folderInfoCollection:
	print("Folder: " + folderInfo.display_name)
	print("Total Items: " + str(folderInfo.content_count))
	print("Total Unread Items: " + str(folderInfo.content_unread_count))
	print("----------------------")
```

## Send Bulk Emails via SMTP using Python

```python
message1 = MailMessage("from@gmail.com", "to@gmail.com", "Sending Bulk Emails using Aspose.Email", "message1, how are you?")
message2 = MailMessage("from@gmail.com", "to@gmail.com", "Sending Bulk Emails using Aspose.Email", "message2, how are you?")
message3 = MailMessage("from@gmail.com", "to@gmail.com", "Sending Bulk Emails using Aspose.Email", "message3, how are you?")

manyMsg =  MailMessageCollection()
manyMsg.append(message1)
manyMsg.append(message2)
manyMsg.append(message3)

#Send using Smtp Client
client = SmtpClient("smtp.gmail.com", 995, "username", "password")
client.security_options = SecurityOptions.AUTO

client.send(manyMsg)
```
